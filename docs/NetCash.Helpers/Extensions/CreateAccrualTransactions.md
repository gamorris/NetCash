# Extensions.CreateAccrualTransactions method

Create accrual transactions between two accounts. (I really need some feedback on the naming and the description.)

```csharp
public static void CreateAccrualTransactions(this Book book, Account fromAccount, 
    Account toAccount, int months, DateOnly startDate, GncNumeric targetBalance)
```

## Remarks

This is useful for creating future transactions for scenarios like deprecation or prepaid expenses or whatever. It will create a sequence of transactions for N months until the final balance of the account reaches the target balance. It also takes care of the balance adjustment: Let's say the currency is of fraction 1/100, you're going to distribute some prepaid expense of 1000 into 3 months, so there will be 3 expense transactions of value 1000/3 each, GnuCash will try to convert the value to match the fraction of the currency, so it will become 33333/100, that is 333.33 in floating-point, as a result, there will be 0.01 left in the balance of the prepaid expense account, which is not desired. This method will try to adjust the last transaction so it becomes: 333.33 333.33 333.34 I'm not sure if there is a common practice for this, but I use this method for my personal accounting anyway.
