# Book.Open method

Openes an existing book.

```csharp
public static Book Open(GnuCashUri uri, bool ignoreLock = false)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| uri | URI to the book. |
| ignoreLock | true to take over the existing lock if necessary. |

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| GnuCashBackendException | Throws when an error occured while opening the book. |

## Remarks

For XML backend, when it opens a book for writing, it creates a backup file with timestamp "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" in the name. So if your code tries to open/close a book twice within one second, the latter session will try to make a backup file with the same name created by previous session, and it's going to fail with ERR_FILEIO_BACKUP_ERROR, because the backup file is created using the combination of O_CREAT and O_EXCL, which disallows overwriting an existing file.
