# Book.DeleteAccount method

Deletes an account.

```csharp
public void DeleteAccount(Account acct)
```

## Remarks

* The underlying native resource gets destroyed after this operation, although the managed Account object is still accessible, it becomes invalid, any usage afterwards would get unexpected result.
* The account has to be empty before being deleted, otherwise an exception is thrown.
