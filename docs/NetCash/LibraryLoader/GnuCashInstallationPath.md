# LibraryLoader.GnuCashInstallationPath property

The installation path of GnuCash, e.g. "/opt/gnucash-unstable". NetCash will try determine this value by looking for PATH environment variable and conventional locations such as "/opt/gnucash" on *nix or "Program Files (x86)\gnucash" on Windows. If your installation path is none of the above, you have to specify this value before NetCash can work properly.

```csharp
public static string GnuCashInstallationPath { get; set; }
```
