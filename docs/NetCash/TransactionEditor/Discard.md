# TransactionEditor.Discard method

Rollbacks changes made to the transaction.

```csharp
public void Discard()
```

## Remarks

NOTE: This might not rollback all the changes, according to the comment in GnuCash codebase: "The Rollback function is terribly complex, and, what's worse, it only rolls back the basics. The TransCommit functions did a bunch of Lot/Cap-gains scrubbing that don't get addressed/undone here, and so the rollback can potentially leave a bit of a mess behind."
